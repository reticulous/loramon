/**
 * loramon_lcd.cpp — "LoRaMon": per-on-air-frame airtime/signal monitor painted
 * by hand into one RGB565 canvas. The on-device sibling of the browser LoRaMon
 * window; the LCD counterpart to actmon_app.cpp.
 *
 *   Per-radio tabs (lora/0, lora/1, …), then a row of window pills (10s, 1m,
 *   5m, 10m, 30m, 1hr) selecting the time span shown. One plot, newest at the
 *   right edge, carrying both directions: each frame is a bar spanning its
 *   time-on-air, placed at its power on one of two dBm axes over the same four
 *   bands — transmit −10…+30 dBm down the left gutter in 10 dB steps, receive
 *   −128…0 dBm down the right in 32 dB. Colour is direction and audience: red
 *   is what this radio put on the air, blue what arrived, light for a broadcast
 *   anyone may read and dark for a frame with one addressee. Grey is somebody
 *   else's unicast — on the air, but not our conversation — and purple a frame
 *   whose CRC failed, which is neither, since nothing in it was readable.
 *
 *   A run of frames sharing a peer is named by a pill beside it, and `attr` at
 *   the right-hand end of the pill row is the switch for that layer: it is the
 *   only thing drawn over the traffic rather than beside it, so a crowded view
 *   can have it taken off. The axis names stand in their own gutters, between
 *   the top band edge's figure and the one below it, which is what lets the
 *   pill strip run the full width of the screen.
 *
 *   Touching a frame prints what it is and who it was with along the top of the
 *   plot; the hit test runs across every channel lane at that instant, so a
 *   train is inspectable wherever it is on screen.
 *
 *   Touching the graph starts a highlighted span at that instant. Because the
 *   anchor is a *time*, not a pixel, holding still on a live graph widens the
 *   highlight — the anchor drifts left as "now" advances. Releasing zooms to
 *   the span and pushes it on a zoom stack; the pills give way to a single back
 *   pill. A zoomed view stands still, so it can carry a timescale: division
 *   lines in the gradient's own darkest tone, with the span and what one
 *   division is worth printed beside the back pill.
 *   Selecting inside it zooms further, pushing another level. Back pops one and
 *   is blue while a single level is left — while it leads back to the live
 *   window — and emptying the stack returns to whichever moving window was
 *   active.
 *
 * Source of truth is storage: the firmware publishes one node per frame at
 * `lora.<n>.packets.<ms>` = "r|rssi|snr|dur|bytes|type|ch|desc|cast[|tag]" (rx)
 * / "t|txp|dur|bytes|type|wait|ch|own|desc|cast[|tag]" (tx) / "a|ch|dur" (a
 * dwell — where the radio was), and deletes them past 1 h. We rebuild our view
 * by iterating that subtree each redraw (so expiry — which doesn't fire
 * subscribe callbacks — is handled), and setting `sys.stats.lcd_loramon` tells
 * the firmware to record while we're up. The caption's two figures — what we
 * transmitted, and how much of the channel was in use at all — are computed
 * here from those records for the selected window; the 1-hour pair is the one
 * the firmware publishes itself (`lora.<n>.air1h.{rx,tx}`, per mille), because
 * it covers more history than this app is typically open for.
