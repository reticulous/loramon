   * does, and a label that will not fit disappears entirely from traffic that
   * is plainly there.
   *
   * The two channel kinds fall out of ONE rule — mark wherever the attribution
   * changes — because they carry the answer in different records, and they
   * differ only in which side of the mark the pill sits:
   *
   *   - the hailing channel has no meetings, so only frames are tagged: the
   *     first attributable frame on screen gets a pill (nothing precedes it in
   *     view to have established the name), and after that every change does.
   *     The pill starts AT the frame — the traffic runs on to the right of it,
   *     and the name is the head of that run.
   *   - a detour channel is attended in slots, and a slot belongs to its peer
   *     for its whole width even if nothing arrives in it. The dwell carries
   *     that, so a slot is named on its own beginning rather than on whichever
   *     frame happened to be first inside it, and an empty slot is still named.
   *     The pill sits just BEFORE the slot opens, clear of it: a window is a
   *     bounded thing with its own left edge, and a label laid over that edge
   *     hides where the window starts — which on a lane whose whole point is
   *     "we were listening from here to here" is the one thing not to cover.
   *
   * A dwell additionally starts a new pill when it does not continue the
   * previous stay, so two consecutive slots with the SAME peer read as two
   * slots. A frame never does: an untagged frame between two of a peer's
   * frames — somebody else's broadcast, overheard — is not a change of who
   * this lane is with, and clearing the run on it would re-label the same
   * conversation every time the air was shared.
